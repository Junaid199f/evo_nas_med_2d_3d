## Overview 
This repository contains the Python implementation of Evolutionary Framework for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification
The framework extended the DARTS search space for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification and MealPy library for the implementation of metaheurstics.
For more details, please refer to our paper [Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification](https://www.iccs-meeting.org/archive/iccs2024/papers/148330121.pdf) by Muhammad Junaid Ali, Laurent Moalic, Mokhtar Essaid and Lhassane Idoumghar.
