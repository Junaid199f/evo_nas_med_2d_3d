## Overview 
-  This repository contains the Python implementation of Evolutionary Framework for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification
-  The framework extended the DARTS search space for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification and MealPy library for the implementation of metaheurstics.
-  For more details, please refer to our paper [Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search for 2D and 3D Medical Image Classification](https://www.iccs-meeting.org/archive/iccs2024/papers/148330121.pdf) by Muhammad Junaid Ali, Laurent Moalic, Mokhtar Essaid and Lhassane Idoumghar.
